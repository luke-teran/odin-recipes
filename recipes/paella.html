        <h3>Paella</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
                <li>8 ounces chorizo sausage, sliced into thin rounds</li>
                <li>½ yellow onion, diced</li>
                <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>1 ⅓ cups Arborio rice</li>
                <li>½ cup green peas</li>
                <li>1 red bell pepper, cut into thin strips</li>
                <li>salt to taste</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
                <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or more to taste</li>
            </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook and stir reserved shrimp shells and 2 teaspoons olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat until shells are pink and fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir saffron into shells; add chicken broth, bring to a simmer, and cook until broth is a rusty brown and fragrant, about 20 minutes.</li><br>
            <li>Strain saffron broth through a fine-mesh sieve; measure out 2 cups of broth, pour into a small saucepan, and place over low heat to keep broth hot.</li><br>
            <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li><br>
            <li>Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large, oven-proof skillet over medium heat. Cook chorizo slices in hot oil until browned, about 2 minutes per side. Add onion to sausage; cook and stir until soft and slightly translucent, about 3 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low.</li><br>
            <li>Stir garlic into chorizo mixture; cook and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add rice to skillet and stir to coat rice completely in oil; stir in peas.</li><br>
            <li>Pat rice mixture evenly into the bottom of the skillet. Arrange shrimp in a single layer over the top of the rice. Lay pepper strips around and in between shrimp; season with salt, paprika, and cayenne pepper.</li><br>
            <li>Increase heat to high. When rice begins to sizzle in the skillet, pour reserved 2 cups hot saffron broth over the shrimp; gently shake the skillet to distribute liquid.</li><br>
            <li>Bake rice mixture in the preheated oven until rice is almost tender and still a bit wet, about 20 minutes.</li><br>
            <li>Place skillet over medium-high and cook until rice is tender, liquid is absorbed, and rice caramelizes and crusts slightly on the bottom of the skillet, 3 to 5 minutes.</li><br>
        </ol>
    <h3>Chef's Tip</h3>
        <p>You can substitute smoked paprika for paprika, chicken broth for saffron broth, and any smoky, spicy sausage for chorizo</p>
